description = [[Adds more 1H staves with more variety to the game.

1H staves are so hard to find because in the base game there are only 2 egos that make a staff 1H.
This addon adds more 1H staff egos that are based on some of the existing 2H staff egos, but with some of the bonuses toned down.
Also slightly expands the number of staves available in staff stores to account for the wider variety.
