description = [[Adds more 1H staves with more variety to the game.

1H staves are so hard to find because in the base game there are only 2 egos that make a staff 1H.
This addon adds more 1H staff egos that are based on some of the existing 2H staff egos, but with some of the bonuses toned down.
Also slightly expands the number of staves available in staff stores to account for the wider variety.

---Changelog
- v1.0.0 Initial release
- v1.0.1 Changed the new 1H staves proc bonus from 2.5 (which is normal for 2H staves) to 1.2 (which is normal for 1H staves).
- v1.0.2 Took a few egos out because when the higher level/rarity staves are created they randomly get egos and if any ego is a 1H then the staff is 1H, meaning that too many of the higher level/rarity staves were 1H. Fewer 1H egos means lower chances of a 1H ego so it should be more balanced now.
